# Instructions for connecting to a GPU Compute node in UARK HPC Resource

Before connecting to any compute resources, your local system must be connected to the University directly or through 
the university VPN. Connections will not be allowed otherwise.

Once on the University's network, connect to the HPC Login Node with an ssh call in the local terminal.
The call will take a username and the server address of the on-campus HPC. Should look like this line:

ssh <user_name>@hpc-portal2.hpc.uark.edu
