### Convolutional Neural Networks

Computer vision is a subfield of computer science that focuses on enabling computers to understand and parse images. Object detection/localization in images is a common problem in computer vision common problem in computer vision--object detection is a technique that deals with detecting instances of objects of a certain class in digital images and videos.  Before the widespread adoption of neural network-based methods, the field of object detection relied on various non-neural approaches that, while innovative for their time, were generally less effective at accurately and robustly detecting objects in complex images. Neural network-based methods became the focus of the research with the improvement of compuational resources necessary to fully utilize them. The field experimented with a multitude of network architectures, each with varying success in terms of accuracy and speed.

The convolutional neural network (CNN), or ConvNet, is one of the most widely-used, effective architecture, finding use in facial recognition, autonomously-operated robots and cars, and more.
