    "- **Recall**: Measures the model's ability to detect all relevant instances, i.e., the percentage of correct positive predictions out of all actual positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are crucial for understanding the trade-off between correctly detecting objects (recall) and minimizing false positives (precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> mAP (Mean Average Precision) </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "mAP is a comprehensive metric used to evaluate the accuracy of object detectors like YOLO. It averages the precision-recall curve into a single value, providing an overall measure of the model's performance across all classes and IoU (Intersection over Union) thresholds. High mAP values indicate a robust model capable of accurately detecting and classifying objects across different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Detection Speed </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO is designed for real-time object detection, and its detection speed (usually measured in FPS, frames per second) is a crucial output. This metric tells us how fast the model can process images to detect objects, which is vital for applications requiring real-time analysis, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Visualization of Detections </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, visualizing the detections made by the YOLO model on test images or videos is an intuitive way to understand the model's performance. These visualizations typically include bounding boxes around detected objects, class labels, and confidence scores. They provide immediate visual feedback on how well the model can detect and classify objects in various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Trained Model Directory Structure </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully training a YOLO model, the next steps involve accessing the trained model for inference or further fine-tuning. The trained model weights are typically saved in a specific directory structure, often under a `weights` folder and within `runs` folders for different experiments. Understanding how to navigate these folders and use the saved weights is crucial for applying your YOLO model to real-world tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weights Folder**: This folder contains the saved weights of your model after training. YOLO saves weights at regular intervals during training, as well as the final weights once training is complete. The saved weights include:\n",
    "  - `best.pt`: The weights of the model that achieved the best performance on the validation set during training.\n",
    "  - `last.pt`: The weights of the model at the last training epoch. These may not be the best-performing weights but are useful for resuming training.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Runs Folder**: The `runs` folder is organized by training experiments. Each experiment (or training run) has its own subfolder, typically named with the experiment's start date and time or a custom name you specify. Within each experiment's folder, you'll find:\n",
    "  - Subfolders for each training phase (e.g., `train`, `val`), containing logs and outputs specific to those phases.\n",
    "  - TensorBoard logs, if TensorBoard was used during training, allowing you to visually monitor the training process.\n",
    "  - Any additional outputs specified during training, such as plots of the loss function over time, precision-recall curves, and example predictions.\n"
